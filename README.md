# Getting started with Gulp
This is a basic 'getting started with Gulp' project. I made this to assist a talk I did in Sept 2018 - at the Bristol WordPress 
meetup group - https://www.meetup.com/wpbristol/

Gulp is a great tool for automating development tasks and saving you time! I currently use Gulp to compile, error check and minify 
my SASS, JS and CSS. I also use it to optimise images and live inject file changes to the browser to give live updates whilst I'm coding.

### Before you get going...
You'll need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine before you can start using Gulp. 

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can use it to install and update Node.js

Otherwise, this is a [great guide](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for getting setup with Node and NPM - 

### Installing Gulp
Next, you'll need to install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). The getting started guide on their [official repo](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/v3.9.1/docs/getting-started.md) is the best.
